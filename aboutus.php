                    		  <p> RAWW’s logo is an ideogram, a symbol that defines our vision while juxtaposing Mother Earth’s current state. A black sphere outlined by a green strip. If we look at it from the angle of mankind’s legacy, we see darkness engulf the green, Nature, swallowing and spreading from the inside. The future, if the current scenario persists, may rightly remember our species as the ‘amazingly clever, yet utterly foolish two-legged apes’.</p> 
<p>
But we hope, with all our might and courage, to counter our wrongdoings by working together. The green strip is the beginning which will magically spread and make Mother Earth alive again! We work hard everyday, with hope in our eyes, for this is the future that we need, and which all living beings rightly deserve.</p>
